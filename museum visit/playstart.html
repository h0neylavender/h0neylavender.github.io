    <box1> *To destress from the terrible pandamonium that is finals week, your professor decides it would be best for you
        all to take a little field trip to the museum! A choice that wasn't very well recieved, but nonetheless you and your peers trudged
        along through anyways. It's extra credit after all.. Click on your peers to listen in on their conversations!* </box1>
